# teg-rest
teg-rest is a simple Clojure program, based on conexp-clj, that provides an api
to the exploration algorithm from [Formal Concept
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis).

## Installation
You would need to download the clojure build tool
[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to use this software. 

You can run the api by typing 
```shell
lein run
```
or 
```shell
lein repl
```
which would provide a REPL in which one can start the API server using:

```clojure
(-main)
```

Both will result in the availability of
